# Employee-database-login-and-management-system
Employee database login and management system, where you can register new user; log as an user, change your data or delete account; log as an administrator and manage data of all users.

Password to log as an administrator = "admin".

To connect with local server to set up database I use XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/pl/index.html)
I use mySQL database.
To create GUI i used Java Swing.

Thanks to all Indian youtubers who helped me create this project!
